 *  \param     new_state        Here is a list of possible states:
 *             - RX_ON        Requested transition to RX_ON state.
 *             - TRX_OFF      Requested transition to TRX_OFF state.
 *             - PLL_ON       Requested transition to PLL_ON state.
 *             - RX_AACK_ON   Requested transition to RX_AACK_ON state.
 *             - TX_ARET_ON   Requested transition to TX_ARET_ON state.
 *
 *  \retval    RADIO_SUCCESS          Requested state transition completed
 *                                  successfully.
 *  \retval    RADIO_INVALID_ARGUMENT Supplied function parameter out of bounds.
 *  \retval    RADIO_WRONG_STATE      Illegal state to do transition from.
 *  \retval    RADIO_BUSY_STATE       The radio transceiver is busy.
 *  \retval    RADIO_TIMED_OUT        The state transition could not be completed
 *                                  within resonable time.

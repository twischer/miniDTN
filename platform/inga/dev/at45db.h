/**
 * \defgroup AT45DB_interface Atmel Flash EEPROM AT45DB interface
 *
 * <p>A fixed Flash EEPROM is always good to store some data. Furthermore
 * in this project environment, the AT45DBxx1 will be used as a hardware
 * interface between the boot section and the application section.</p>
 *
 * \note
 * All functions will return immediately if flash is uninitialized
 * or initialization failed.
 *
 * \note
 * The function of the AT45DBxx1 is a little bit different compared to
 * an SD-Card. The basic idea of the SD-Card is, to store one block
 * (512Byte) into a local buffer an transfer the whole block via SPI
 * to the SD-Card.
 * The AT45DBxx1 has two page buffer, where the data can be collected by
 * sending a byte via SPI to one of these buffers. If a buffer is filled,
 * only a command is necessary and the AT45DBxx1 will copy the buffer into
 * the flash section. To avoid latency, it is possible (and implemented)
 * to switch between the page buffers.

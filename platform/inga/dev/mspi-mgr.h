/**
 * \defgroup spi_bus_manager Master SPI Bus Manager
 *
 * <p>The various SPI devices are all connected to the SPI Bus (SCK, MOSI/SDA,
 *    MISO/SDI) and only separated by the Chip Select. With a high probability,
 *    not every SPI Device will use the same SPI Bus configuration (SPI Mode), so
 *    you would have to change (or to check) the SPI mode whenever accessing another
 *    SPI device. But in higher software layers you are not interested in such
 *    details like SPI Mode. Therefore the SPI Bus Manager was implemented, to separate
 *    the low level hardware and register level from higher software layers.
 *    The SPI Bus Manager holds all devices, which are connected to the SPI Bus. With
 *    a checksum he can decide, if the SPI configuration has to change. So in some cases
 *    these reconfiguration can be avoid.</p>
 *    \note If you know what you are doing, it is possible to disable the SPI Bus Manager
 *    by setting MSPI_BUS_MANAGER in the mspi-drv.h to 0.

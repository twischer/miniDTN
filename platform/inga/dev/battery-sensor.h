 * This sensor interface allows to monitor the supply voltage and current
 * of the INGA sensor platform.
 *
 * \section query_measure Query measurements
 * <code>acc_sensor.value(channel)</code>
 *
 * The sensor provides 2 data channels.
 * - One provides battery voltage level
 * - One provides battery current
 * A detailed list can be found at \ref batt_out_channels "Data Output Channels"

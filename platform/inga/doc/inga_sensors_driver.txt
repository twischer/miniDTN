 * 
 * \section about About
 * 
 * These are the low level hardware drivers for the new developed sensor node,
 * which was designed and developed by Ulf Kulau during his project thesis. The
 * sensor node is based on the Atmel AVR Raven so please use the following
 * datasheets for further information about the hardware:
 * <ul>
 * <li>ATmega164A/164PA/324A/324PA/644A/644PA/1284/1284P
 * <li>AT86RF230
 * </ul>
 * 
 * \section usage Usage

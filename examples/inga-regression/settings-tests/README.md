Settings manager test cases
===

settings-set
---

Sets valid default values for all available settings.
Node ids are set to the id configured in the used node config file

settings-set-chaotic
---

Similar to settings-set but imaginative values are set.

To end with a well configured node, this test should be executed
only **before** settings-set.

Prerequisites
===

To run test.py / profile-neat.py (with INGA) the following requirements have to be met:

1. python >= 2.7 (e.g. Debian Testing/Wheezy)

2. Installed packages

    aptitude install python-yaml python-serial python-argparse python2.7-pygraphviz gcc-avr avrdude avr-libc python-pyparsing inkscape

3. python-pydot >= 1.0.23 (e.g. 1.0.28)

    aptitude install python-setuptools
    easy_install pydot

4. Read/Write access for INGA-Devices (/dev/ttyUSB*, e.g. via udev-rule)

5. Correct Values for "logbase", "contikibase" and correct device-configuration in config.yaml (all paths have to be absolute)

6. test.py attempts to build inga-tool , see: <contikibase>tools/inga/inga_tool/README , 
    (aptitude install libftdi-dev libusb-dev libudev-dev libpopt-dev)
    inga-tool sources are expected to be at: <contikibase>tools/inga/inga_tool/
    profile-neat.py is expected to be at: <contikibase>tools/profiling/

Added:
- Option -r only resets device for test but does neither build nor upload coade
- config file option 'repeated' allows to configure a test repetition summed up in a single log file

Usage
===

Suite configuration
---

Allows to set basic information such as contiki base dir, logdir etc.
Lets you choose a set of directorier with 'test_config.yaml' files and
a (sub)set of tests of tests that should be executed

Note: Old usage with only a single test_config is still supported partly

Node configuration
---

Holds information about nodes available for test

Test configuration
---

Defines tests.



How to set target addresses in source files:
You can add `-DCONF_DEST_NODE=$MYNODE` in your `test_config.yaml`.
If your `node_config.yaml` defines a device called `mynode` the test script will automatically replace
the upright variant `$MYNODE` with the id configured for that node.
Note: This is also true for `-DCONF_SEND_TO_NODE=$MYNODE`
